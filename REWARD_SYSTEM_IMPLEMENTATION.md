# Reward System Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive reward system for the Cube ERP that allows administrators to deduct a portion of revenue to increase reward pools and distribute rewards to employees during special events or at the end of each month. Employees can view the total value of the reward pool for motivation.

## Architecture

### Backend Components

#### 1. Database Models

- **RewardPool Model** (`/server/src/api/models/rewardPool.model.ts`)

  - Stores reward pool information including name, description, amounts, status, event type, and dates
  - Tracks current and total amounts for each pool
  - Links to employee who created the pool

- **RewardDistribution Model** (`/server/src/api/models/rewardDistribution.model.ts`)
  - Records individual reward distributions to employees
  - Tracks amount, status, distribution date, and notes
  - Links to both reward pool and recipient employee

#### 2. API Controllers

- **RewardController** (`/server/src/api/controllers/reward.controller.ts`)
  - Handles all reward-related API endpoints
  - Implements CRUD operations for reward pools
  - Manages deduction and distribution operations
  - Provides statistics for both admins and employees

#### 3. Services

- **Reward Service** (`/server/src/api/services/reward.service.ts`)
  - Business logic for reward pool management
  - Financial operations (deductions from revenue)
  - Distribution logic with validation
  - Statistics calculation and aggregation

#### 4. API Routes

- **Admin Routes** (`/server/src/api/routers/reward/index.ts`)

  - `/api/v1/rewards/pools` - CRUD operations for reward pools
  - `/api/v1/rewards/pools/deduct` - Deduct revenue to pools
  - `/api/v1/rewards/distribute` - Distribute rewards to employees
  - `/api/v1/rewards/stats` - Get pool statistics

- **Employee Routes** (`/server/src/api/routers/reward/employee.ts`)
  - `/api/v1/employees/me/rewards/stats` - Employee's own reward stats
  - `/api/v1/employees/me/rewards/pools/stats` - Current pool information

#### 5. Data Validation

- **Reward Schemas** (`/server/src/api/schemas/reward.schema.ts`)
  - Comprehensive validation for all reward operations
  - Type-safe schema definitions with Zod
  - Input validation for pools, deductions, and distributions

#### 6. Constants

- **Reward Constants** (`/server/src/api/constants/reward.constant.ts`)
  - Pool statuses: active, distributed, closed
  - Event types: holiday, new_year, monthly, quarterly, achievement, special, other
  - Distribution methods: equal, performance, seniority, custom

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Services

- **Reward Service** (`/client/app/services/reward.server.ts`)
  - Client-side API communication
  - Type-safe interfaces matching backend models
  - Methods for all reward operations

#### 2. Admin Interface

- **Pool Management** (`/client/app/routes/erp+/_admin+/rewards+/pools+/index.tsx`)

  - List view of all reward pools with filtering and search
  - Status and event type badges
  - Financial overview (total, current, remaining amounts)
  - Bulk operations support

- **Pool Creation** (`/client/app/routes/erp+/_admin+/rewards+/pools+/new.tsx`)

  - Form for creating new reward pools
  - Event type selection
  - Date range configuration
  - Validation and error handling

- **Pool Details** (`/client/app/routes/erp+/_admin+/rewards+/pools+/$id.tsx`)
  - Detailed view of individual pools
  - Revenue deduction interface
  - Employee reward distribution system
  - Real-time balance tracking

#### 3. Employee Interface

- **Employee Dashboard** (`/client/app/routes/erp+/nhan-vien+/rewards+/index.tsx`)
  - Personal reward statistics
  - Company-wide pool information for motivation
  - Recent reward history
  - Visual cards showing key metrics

## Key Features

### For Administrators

1. **Revenue Deduction**

   - Deduct specified amounts from company revenue
   - Add funds to reward pools with transaction tracking
   - Automatic balance updates

2. **Reward Pool Management**

   - Create pools for different events (holidays, achievements, etc.)
   - Set start and end dates
   - Track pool status lifecycle

3. **Reward Distribution**

   - Distribute rewards to selected employees
   - Custom amount per employee
   - Add notes for each distribution
   - Validation against available pool balance

4. **Financial Tracking**
   - Complete audit trail of all transactions
   - Real-time balance calculations
   - Distribution history and statistics

### For Employees

1. **Motivation Dashboard**

   - View total available reward pool amounts
   - See number of active pools
   - Track personal reward history

2. **Transparency**
   - Access to company-wide reward statistics
   - Recent distribution activities
   - Event-based reward information

## Security & Permissions

- **Authentication Required**: All routes require user authentication
- **Role-Based Access**:
  - Admins have full CRUD access to reward system
  - Employees can only view their own stats and general pool info
- **Permission Middleware**: Granular permissions for reward operations
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation on all endpoints

## Database Integration

- **Transaction Support**: Financial operations use database transactions for consistency
- **Referential Integrity**: Foreign key constraints between pools, distributions, and employees
- **Indexing**: Optimized queries with proper database indexes
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all reward-related activities

## API Endpoints Summary

### Admin Endpoints

```
POST   /api/v1/rewards/pools              - Create reward pool
GET    /api/v1/rewards/pools              - List reward pools

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Reward Pool

1. Admin navigates to `/erp/_admin/rewards/pools/new`
2. Fills out form with pool details (name, event type, dates, initial amount)
3. System creates pool with "active" status
4. Pool appears in admin dashboard

### Deducting Revenue

1. Admin opens specific pool detail page
2. Clicks "Deduct Revenue" button
3. Enters amount and optional description
4. System creates transaction record and updates pool balance

### Distributing Rewards

1. Admin selects "Distribute Rewards" from pool detail page
2. Selects employees and amounts for each
3. System validates against available balance
4. Creates distribution records and updates pool status

### Employee Viewing Rewards

1. Employee navigates to `/erp/nhan-vien/rewards`
2. Views dashboard with pool statistics for motivation
3. Sees personal reward history
4. Tracks company-wide reward activities

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready reward system that motivates employees through transparency while giving administrators full control over reward distribution and financial tracking.
